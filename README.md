# JETI Ex Bus protocol
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)


A [JETI](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/) [Ex Bus protocol](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/Telemetry-Protocol/) implementation in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).
This will allow to use boards like RaspberyPi, ESP3286 or similar to act as sensors for Jeti RC [receivers](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/katalog/Duplex-2-4-EX/Receivers-EX/) and transmit telemetry data from the board to the receiver and thus back to the transmitter (i.e. RC controls like this [DC24](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/katalog/Transmitters/@produkt/DC-24/)).

>
> NOTE: This is a rather a proof of concept at the moment and NOT ready for use yet.
