# JETI Ex Bus protocol (Python)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)


A [JETI](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/) [Ex Bus protocol](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/Telemetry-Protocol/) implementation in Python or more specifically in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).
This will allow to use boards like RaspberyPi, ESP3286 or similar to act as a sensor hub for Jeti RC [receivers](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/katalog/Duplex-2-4-EX/Receivers-EX/) and transmit telemetry data from the board to the receiver and thus back to the transmitter (i.e. RC controls like this [DC24](http://www.jetimodel.com/en/katalog/Transmitters/@produkt/DC-24/)).


> NOTE: This is currently rather a proof of concept and NOT ready for use.
> I use this mainly to learn about serial communication between microcontrollers and/or RC devices.

> NOTE: My first tests will be done in a classical linear programming way (no asynchronous operations).
> I'll check how far I can come with this somewhat simpler approach.

> NOTE: Possibly I will be studying uasyncio which seems to be the proper way of implementing the Ex Bus protocol.
> For reference see [this example](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/v3/as_demos/auart_hd.py).


## Features (planned)

 - Pure Python (MicroPython) impementation of the Jeti Ex Bus protocol
 - Runs on boards which are supported by MicroPython (see [forum](https://forum.micropython.org/viewforum.php?f=10) or [code repository](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports))
 - Simple firmware update via USB
 - Easy logging of sensor data on the board (SD card, etc.)

## Boards tested

 - [Pyboard](https://store.micropython.org/product/PYBv1.1) 
   - This board is used for the development
   - STM32F405RG microcontroller
   - 168 MHz Cortex M4 CPU
 - Planned: [TINY2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2040)
 - Planned: [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266)

## Dependencies

 - [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/)

## Test setup

The following image shows the components and connections as used during the developmnet.

The Pyboard is in a small housing and a Jeti REX6 receiver is attached. The yellow wire (channel 6) splits into two wires (one with a 2.4kOhm resistor as per the Jeti specification) which are connected to TX(Y9) and RX(Y10) on UART(3) on the Pyboard. The black wire establishes a common ground. The receiver is powered by a 4S NiMH Eneloop accumulator via channel 1. Channel 6 of the receiver was set to "Ex Bus" (see image below) in the device manager of the Jeti transmitter.
